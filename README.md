# Personal website

## Tech stack

- TypeScript
- React (with hooks)
- Gatsby (with too many plugins)
- Grommet
- styled-components
- (inline) Mdx
- Svgr
- Netlify

## Cool stuff

- Custom ts typings
- Over-engineered mdx setup
- `useMedia` hook
- Custom svgs
- Blank white hero, that somehow looks OK
- Nice tool-tips
- Blog ready (if I'll ever write something)
